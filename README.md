# Shopping-List
### Description
This is a simple website to create a detailed shopping list. It is one of my first web design projects and I made it to mainly get better at JavaScript. To use this program, users may add a single food item to their shopping list or add a category such as ingredients for a lunch or dinner.

I am looking for contributors to modify the overall design of the webpage because it seems dull and boring. There is still a lot of work that can be done to the css to make the website look better. I have also not found a good solution to resize the text size of each item to fit inside the div so if someone enters something that is to large it will overflow and intersect with other text.
